      <h4>About <em>Tech Role Models</em></h4>

      <p>
        The people presented here serve as role-models for folks in Norway trying to build a career working hands-on in tech.
      </p>

      <p>
        The selection for inclusion is based on hands-on contributions and not on role or career path. Acknowledging that many contributions are often not publicly visible, we try to enumerate contributions as well as we can.
      </p>
